0
0:04:15.750 --> 0:04:17.830
Destruction through a foreign land

1
0:04:17.850 --> 0:04:19.790
To the world of destruction

2
0:04:20.990 --> 0:04:22.230
In the sun of the galaxy

3
0:04:34.760 --> 0:04:35.330
They are the

4
0:04:35.330 --> 0:04:36.480
BOMBS OF THE ENEMIES

5
0:04:37.610 --> 0:04:39.110
Of the never-ending fate

6
0:05:41.520 --> 0:05:42.460
They are the

7
0:06:04.140 --> 0:06:04.510
BOMBS

8
0:06:04.510 --> 0:07:01.230
OF THE ENEMIES

9
0:07:01.230 --> 0:07:02.390
Brothers eyes are dark

10
0:07:05.350 --> 0:07:06.890
Nameless boxes gray

11
0:07:09.420 --> 0:07:10.380
And their shadows

12
0:11:21.560 --> 0:11:26.630
Oh, oh, oh

13
0:12:17.770 --> 0:12:22.190
The last way we go

14
0:12:25.290 --> 0:12:52.350
Oh, oh, oh

15
0:12:52.350 --> 0:12:53.470
The fourth is the last

16
0:12:53.670 --> 0:12:54.530
The third is the last

17
0:12:54.530 --> 0:12:56.390
The fourth is the last

18
0:12:56.390 --> 0:12:57.050
The fourth is the last

19
0:12:57.050 --> 0:12:57.370
The fourth is the last

20
0:14:26.920 --> 0:14:27.920
In Blomstock

21
0:14:51.600 --> 0:14:54.080
And I remember the people who were in the front row

22
0:14:54.680 --> 0:14:57.180
Were all pretty damn hangover, okay, or hungover, sorry

23
0:14:57.680 --> 0:15:00.120
And I remember when I asked you to headbang

24
0:15:00.600 --> 0:15:01.740
You all headbanged once

25
0:15:03.250 --> 0:15:06.040
Then you realized how much bigger you had the night before

26
0:15:07.060 --> 0:15:11.260
So, however, we do have a little bit more than 20 minutes tonight

27
0:15:14.830 --> 0:15:17.580
We're gonna go all in and do 30 minutes with you guys

28
0:15:20.080 --> 0:15:21.990
Because we're such nice Swedish guys

29
0:15:22.670 --> 0:15:24.290
Anyway, we're gonna do a bit of a mix here

30
0:15:24.350 --> 0:15:26.850
Obviously we just released a new album called The Great War

31
0:15:28.960 --> 0:15:30.480
So there will be some stuff from that

32
0:15:30.580 --> 0:15:32.080
There will also be some older stuff

33
0:15:35.130 --> 0:15:37.770
So we're gonna have new shit, old shit

34
0:15:38.810 --> 0:15:40.490
And some songs are just plain shit

35
0:16:00.990 --> 0:16:02.050
You want us to play that song?

36
0:16:07.920 --> 0:16:10.960
Let's do Fields of Verdun!

37
0:16:55.790 --> 0:16:57.070
It's what we're done

38
0:19:37.060 --> 0:19:38.740
Her songs!

39
0:19:41.000 --> 0:19:42.720
Another winter solstice

40
0:20:11.390 --> 0:20:15.050
50 days of siege of number three

41
0:20:16.520 --> 0:20:20.150
Sends a message to the wounded soldiers

42
0:20:20.150 --> 0:20:23.890
Let's provide, will they hold the wall for the win?

43
0:21:04.840 --> 0:21:06.980
No escape and no salvation

44
0:21:14.250 --> 0:21:16.860
The walls and the charges them

45
0:21:17.040 --> 0:21:18.740
And watch the CSPF

46
0:21:33.200 --> 0:21:34.340
Coming down the mountain

47
0:23:51.870 --> 0:24:01.540
1917, overseas to the train

48
0:26:52.980 --> 0:26:55.040
In 1980, time of move

49
0:27:48.450 --> 0:27:50.550
With the sound of our machine gun

50
0:27:52.870 --> 0:27:53.410
Inite

51
0:27:54.520 --> 0:27:56.820
Mortars firing, rings to seed

52
0:27:57.020 --> 0:27:59.680
Scars the fields, and ones were green

53
0:28:00.000 --> 0:28:02.280
This is stalemate at the front line

54
0:28:02.700 --> 0:28:04.720
Where the soldiers rest in mud

55
0:28:05.900 --> 0:28:08.320
Roads and houses, all is gone

56
0:28:08.800 --> 0:28:11.020
There's no glory to be won

57
0:28:11.020 --> 0:28:13.490
Now the many men will suffer

58
0:28:14.050 --> 0:28:16.310
Now the many men will die

59
0:28:18.820 --> 0:28:19.680
Life's at stake

60
0:28:19.900 --> 0:28:22.440
And the fields are passion-filled

61
0:28:22.700 --> 0:28:25.570
As the night falls, the general falls

62
0:28:25.590 --> 0:28:26.990
And the battle can't

63
0:28:29.510 --> 0:28:32.170
What is the purpose of it all?

64
0:28:34.500 --> 0:28:36.440
What's the price of a mile?

65
0:28:37.540 --> 0:28:39.760
Doesn't something through the page

66
0:28:39.960 --> 0:28:44.190
It's a march, don't wait

67
0:28:46.450 --> 0:28:48.090
Guys in yellow and black

68
0:28:50.320 --> 0:28:52.220
Through the page, it's a novel

69
0:28:52.220 --> 0:28:55.580
In the spare, knee-deep

70
0:29:05.970 --> 0:29:08.030
Thousands of machine guns

71
0:29:08.490 --> 0:29:10.310
Get them firing through the night

72
0:29:11.310 --> 0:29:13.930
Mortars blazed, erect the scene

73
0:29:14.310 --> 0:29:16.810
Scars the fields, and ones were green

74
0:29:17.070 --> 0:29:19.310
Still a deadlock at the front line

75
0:29:19.310 --> 0:29:22.010
Where the soldiers die in mud

76
0:29:23.030 --> 0:29:25.430
Roads and houses, six long gone

77
0:29:25.430 --> 0:29:28.310
Still no glory has been won

78
0:29:28.430 --> 0:29:30.650
Now the many men have suffered

79
0:29:34.330 --> 0:29:36.350
Six miles of ground has been won

80
0:29:36.350 --> 0:30:10.460
Help us all, we're on the other side

81
0:31:33.830 --> 0:31:35.390
Bit much to the beat

82
0:31:35.570 --> 0:31:37.890
It's an army on the march

83
0:31:38.590 --> 0:31:41.430
Long way from home

84
0:31:41.590 --> 0:31:44.210
Pay the price, young man's lies

85
0:31:44.550 --> 0:31:46.610
House is up, bit much to the beat

86
0:31:46.610 --> 0:31:49.230
It's an army in the spare

87
0:31:50.590 --> 0:31:52.590
Knee-deep, in mud

88
0:31:53.930 --> 0:31:55.430
With no way out

89
0:32:16.340 --> 0:32:18.600
In a trench with no way out

90
0:33:22.630 --> 0:33:24.570
From the mist, a shape, a ship

91
0:33:24.750 --> 0:33:25.990
Is taking form

92
0:33:26.690 --> 0:33:28.470
And the silence of the seas

93
0:33:28.610 --> 0:33:31.310
Are bound to drift into a storm

94
0:33:32.610 --> 0:33:34.190
Sight of power

95
0:33:35.210 --> 0:33:39.870
Sure for battleships

96
0:33:40.090 --> 0:33:41.590
Floating its course

97
0:33:42.090 --> 0:33:43.830
Crying of our mages

98
0:33:47.540 --> 0:34:18.850
Mocking for a thousand men

99
0:34:18.850 --> 0:34:21.390
Any thousand torches of steel

100
0:34:21.390 --> 0:34:24.210
Trap the cores, or lay Atlantic

101
0:34:24.390 --> 0:34:26.890
With the allies on their heels

102
0:34:33.230 --> 0:34:35.430
Battle stations keep the targets

103
0:34:35.430 --> 0:34:36.750
They're being silenced

104
0:35:31.350 --> 0:35:32.910
In depths of the abyss

105
0:35:32.990 --> 0:35:38.540
They're bound by iron and bloody navy

106
0:35:38.860 --> 0:35:40.400
The terror of the seas

107
0:35:40.740 --> 0:35:43.760
Is guns and then silent at last

108
0:37:30.550 --> 0:37:32.090
The terror of the seas

109
0:37:32.130 --> 0:37:34.550
Missed again the Christmas Eve

110
0:38:17.040 --> 0:38:19.480
This is the best festival in the UK, at least for me personally

111
0:38:22.990 --> 0:38:28.690
You know, the hospitality, the local crew, everyone involved in making Bloodstock happen

112
0:38:28.910 --> 0:38:34.570
Are really fucking good people, so will you please all make some noise for Bloodstock!

113
0:38:40.080 --> 0:38:43.540
Alright, how about a little bit more heavy metal?

114
0:38:45.780 --> 0:38:47.840
How about something with a hammered organ?

115
0:38:50.050 --> 0:38:51.750
How about something about a pirate?

116
0:39:27.850 --> 0:39:28.590
And it's flying

117
0:39:28.590 --> 0:39:29.650
Higher

118
0:39:30.070 --> 0:39:30.970
The king of the sky

119
0:39:34.300 --> 0:39:34.880
Higher

120
0:39:35.120 --> 0:40:08.090
The life of our crew

121
0:40:08.230 --> 0:40:08.990
And it's flying

122
0:40:09.650 --> 0:40:10.110
Higher

123
0:40:10.510 --> 0:40:27.580
The king of the sky

124
0:40:27.580 --> 0:40:29.410
Let's make some noise together my friends

125
0:40:31.780 --> 0:40:34.440
One, two, one, two, three, four

126
0:40:34.560 --> 0:40:35.220
Higher

127
0:40:39.890 --> 0:40:40.430
Higher

128
0:40:46.960 --> 0:40:47.660
One more time

129
0:40:49.510 --> 0:40:50.390
Higher

130
0:41:39.210 --> 0:41:40.050
And it's flying

131
0:41:40.430 --> 0:41:41.230
And it's flying

132
0:41:41.730 --> 0:41:42.450
And it's flying

133
0:41:42.770 --> 0:41:43.550
Higher

134
0:41:43.950 --> 0:43:24.820
The king of the sky

135
0:43:24.840 --> 0:44:32.930
Our horses stand in his soul

136
0:44:43.980 --> 0:45:31.410
We're ready to be the sceptre

137
0:45:46.430 --> 0:47:48.290
You ready for Carola's Wrex?

138
0:48:15.590 --> 0:48:16.510
Face me

139
0:48:18.930 --> 0:48:23.330
Last 50 years have I been waiting

140
0:48:23.410 --> 0:48:25.310
To see it all coming through

141
0:48:32.270 --> 0:48:34.430
Guns, rifles with a wound

142
0:48:56.850 --> 0:48:58.360
I was close to my head

143
0:48:58.360 --> 0:49:00.360
Well, say my name

144
0:49:53.740 --> 0:49:55.350
Question me, you don't

145
0:49:57.470 --> 0:50:00.340
What I say was said in heaven

146
0:50:00.710 --> 0:50:01.790
And so I've started up

147
0:50:10.410 --> 0:50:11.130
All for myself

148
0:50:11.130 --> 0:50:11.700
I am

149
0:50:17.570 --> 0:50:19.170
I was chosen by heaven

150
0:50:19.730 --> 0:50:21.570
Say my name when you pray

151
0:50:21.730 --> 0:50:30.010
To the sky sector

152
0:50:43.180 --> 0:50:46.290
I see Carola's Wrex

153
0:51:02.610 --> 0:51:03.600
Big question right now

154
0:52:19.980 --> 0:52:22.730
I see Carola's Wrex

155
0:56:23.880 --> 0:56:25.720
It sounds better still

156
0:57:09.130 --> 0:57:12.700
Interstand is the strong and the legend still lives on

157
0:57:27.450 --> 0:57:27.770
The

158
0:58:26.370 --> 0:58:27.170
The

159
0:58:37.930 --> 0:58:38.170
The

160
0:58:38.790 --> 0:58:39.510
The

161
0:58:39.570 --> 0:58:40.270
The

162
0:58:40.270 --> 0:58:41.420
The

163
0:58:41.420 --> 0:58:42.650
The

164
0:58:57.010 --> 0:58:57.370
The

165
0:58:57.530 --> 0:58:58.140
The

166
0:58:58.140 --> 0:58:58.750
The

167
0:58:59.410 --> 0:58:59.960
The

168
0:58:59.960 --> 0:59:00.830
The

169
0:59:00.890 --> 0:59:02.430
The

170
0:59:02.590 --> 0:59:03.380
The

171
0:59:03.380 --> 0:59:04.120
The

172
0:59:04.120 --> 0:59:05.090
The

173
0:59:06.410 --> 0:59:06.800
The

174
0:59:06.800 --> 0:59:07.430
The

175
0:59:08.030 --> 0:59:08.050
The

176
0:59:08.830 --> 0:59:09.540
The

177
0:59:09.540 --> 0:59:09.770
The

178
0:59:10.350 --> 0:59:11.370
The

179
0:59:11.570 --> 0:59:12.470
The

181
0:59:13.770 --> 0:59:14.330
The

182
0:59:14.330 --> 0:59:15.550
The

183
0:59:15.930 --> 0:59:16.090
The

184
0:59:17.170 --> 0:59:17.760
The

185
0:59:17.760 --> 0:59:18.800
The

186
0:59:18.800 --> 0:59:19.660
The

187
0:59:19.660 --> 0:59:20.340
The

188
0:59:42.550 --> 0:59:43.400
The

189
0:59:43.400 --> 0:59:43.890
The

190
0:59:43.890 --> 0:59:44.760
The

191
0:59:44.760 --> 0:59:46.510
The

192
0:59:46.630 --> 0:59:47.070
The

193
0:59:47.070 --> 0:59:47.990
The

194
0:59:48.390 --> 0:59:48.590
The

195
0:59:49.390 --> 0:59:50.210
The

196
0:59:50.550 --> 0:59:51.120
The

197
0:59:51.120 --> 0:59:51.450
The

198
0:59:52.650 --> 0:59:52.710
The

199
0:59:52.910 --> 0:59:53.330
The

200
0:59:53.970 --> 0:59:54.860
The

201
0:59:54.860 --> 0:59:55.550
The

202
0:59:55.710 --> 0:59:56.610
The

203
0:59:56.850 --> 0:59:57.980
The

204
0:59:57.980 --> 0:59:58.810
The

205
0:59:59.610 --> 1:00:00.020
The

206
1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:00.980
