0
0:00:11.850 --> 0:00:22.850
Sabaton, Sabaton, Sabaton

1
0:02:20.530 --> 0:02:25.100
Blackstock, we're Sabaton and this is Ghost Division

2
0:02:40.540 --> 0:02:43.340
This is the way the invasion has begun

3
0:02:45.620 --> 0:02:49.140
Shaking the ground with the force of house and guns

4
0:02:50.840 --> 0:02:52.420
Touching the line of fire

5
0:02:53.420 --> 0:02:56.200
Touching two hostile guns, that's leading the way

6
0:02:59.790 --> 0:03:01.490
Leading the way

7
0:03:06.150 --> 0:03:09.290
Charging the lines with the force of a furious roar

8
0:03:11.430 --> 0:03:14.130
Crashing the lightning and the tongues roaring

9
0:03:16.620 --> 0:03:22.500
200 miles an hour, taking with you not a bus or a mermaid

10
0:03:23.620 --> 0:03:24.980
But a new race to take

11
0:03:26.320 --> 0:03:30.460
They are the pups, we're the lees, born to compete, never retreat

12
0:03:31.780 --> 0:03:35.800
Living or dead, always aware, dead or young again

13
0:03:48.870 --> 0:03:52.030
Always ahead, as if it's Knieveling, just run

14
0:03:54.060 --> 0:03:57.280
Making morale with the sound of blazing gun

15
0:03:59.190 --> 0:04:00.870
Touching the line of fire

16
0:04:01.810 --> 0:04:04.690
Touching two hostile guns, that's leading the way

17
0:04:08.210 --> 0:04:09.810
Leading the way

18
0:04:14.570 --> 0:04:17.690
Leaving the trail of destruction to the foreign land

19
0:04:17.870 --> 0:04:19.830
Kill war on the Transnistrian

20
0:04:19.830 --> 0:04:22.130
The Nazi was shot, in the soul of the Nazi

21
0:04:22.430 --> 0:04:24.870
Death and no sedation

22
0:04:25.030 --> 0:04:26.610
Communications broken

23
0:04:27.550 --> 0:04:30.830
Time is the fire when the soldier live

24
0:04:32.010 --> 0:04:33.390
Burning their fame

25
0:04:34.710 --> 0:04:38.950
They are the pups, we're the lees, born to compete, never retreat

26
0:04:40.410 --> 0:04:44.150
Living or dead, always aware, dead or young again

27
0:05:06.770 --> 0:05:08.170
Thank you, Bloodstock!

28
0:05:21.590 --> 0:05:26.710
They sleep from time for the tremendous force of their ancestors

29
0:05:26.930 --> 0:05:29.210
Reaching the way for a panzer, oh

30
0:05:29.410 --> 0:05:32.030
Choking on their death and death stars

31
0:05:32.030 --> 0:05:33.730
Touching the line of fire

32
0:05:34.730 --> 0:05:37.830
Touching two hostile guns, that's leading the way

33
0:05:39.110 --> 0:05:40.490
Leading the way

34
0:05:41.870 --> 0:05:46.070
They are the pups, we're the lees, born to compete, never retreat

35
0:05:46.250 --> 0:05:51.270
Ghost in the flesh, I am the godhead, always aware, dead or young again

36
0:05:52.650 --> 0:05:56.270
Hounds to their knees, born to compete, never retreat

37
0:05:56.430 --> 0:05:57.850
They're hostile and they're not allowed

38
0:05:57.870 --> 0:06:01.530
Living or dead, always aware, dead or young again

39
0:06:11.600 --> 0:06:12.080
Great!

40
0:06:58.360 --> 0:07:02.360
Demolished and paralyzed, my brother's eyes are gone

41
0:07:02.980 --> 0:07:06.920
And we shall all be buried here, in needless marks and screams

42
0:07:07.540 --> 0:07:11.520
Motherhood, get a telegram, and shed a tear of grief

43
0:07:12.140 --> 0:07:16.000
Motherblood in foreign land, trying to understand

44
0:07:18.190 --> 0:07:20.850
Where is this greatness I've been told?

45
0:07:22.750 --> 0:07:25.750
This is the life that I've been sold

46
0:07:27.330 --> 0:07:29.710
Is this a worthy sacrifice?

47
0:07:32.700 --> 0:07:36.100
Great war, and I cannot take more

48
0:07:37.300 --> 0:07:41.070
Great war, I cannot buy shit, no

49
0:07:41.070 --> 0:07:45.080
This is a great story, that we will not undo

50
0:07:46.440 --> 0:07:50.680
Great war, those who've been in our world

51
0:07:59.890 --> 0:08:04.110
I'm standing here, all fluffy, with bodies set like bees

52
0:08:04.730 --> 0:08:08.410
Over there, the other trench, one leg spread by me

53
0:08:09.230 --> 0:08:13.230
Lead on in, as the captain said, and shoot them over the nose

54
0:08:13.890 --> 0:08:17.710
But when my ears prove on the sand, one tell that I may come

55
0:08:19.910 --> 0:08:22.750
Why do my duties pay the price?

56
0:08:24.420 --> 0:08:26.600
How do the world its sacrifice?

57
0:08:29.030 --> 0:08:31.770
I know my deeds are not in vain

58
0:08:34.420 --> 0:08:37.880
Great war, and I cannot take more

59
0:08:38.940 --> 0:08:42.840
Great war, I cannot buy shit, no

60
0:08:43.500 --> 0:08:46.620
This is a great story, that we will not undo

61
0:08:48.180 --> 0:08:52.180
Great war, those who've been in our world

62
0:08:53.040 --> 0:08:57.100
And feet by feet, we pay the price of blood by the hand

63
0:08:57.620 --> 0:09:01.020
Though men may fall, we seek Jesus Christ

64
0:09:02.140 --> 0:09:06.220
We face the heat, as we are fighting until the dawn

65
0:09:06.620 --> 0:09:10.800
So follow me, and we will write our own history

66
0:10:07.690 --> 0:10:14.250
I cannot take more, great war, I cannot buy shit, no

67
0:10:14.250 --> 0:10:18.050
This is a great story, that we will not undo

68
0:10:19.490 --> 0:10:24.130
Great war, those who've been in our world

69
0:10:58.010 --> 0:11:01.150
Wars come as swiftly, the world is closing in

70
0:11:01.450 --> 0:11:04.990
We're a company of soldiers, with a form we write and style

71
0:11:05.190 --> 0:11:10.060
All alone, stand alone

72
0:11:12.950 --> 0:11:16.270
Our death look rather burning, like a lit up hand

73
0:11:16.530 --> 0:11:20.110
As the blitzkrieg's pushing harder, the war is all around

74
0:11:20.350 --> 0:11:25.530
All around, holy ground

75
0:11:27.710 --> 0:11:31.430
Fight for 18 days, the battles, no one's silent on sight

76
0:11:32.130 --> 0:11:35.270
We will fight for all, until the bullets are gone

77
0:11:35.710 --> 0:11:42.610
We, we will resist and fight, fight hard, cause we are gold inside

78
0:11:43.230 --> 0:11:50.290
We, we take our bombs and fight, fight hard, resist and do what's right

79
0:11:58.240 --> 0:12:01.680
No matter how tight it is, the god will cease to count

80
0:12:01.940 --> 0:12:05.700
They don't doubt, and if you cannot keep us, put a new and true flag of failure

81
0:12:05.760 --> 0:12:11.630
We fought hard, and the war was over, and the war is over

82
0:12:12.890 --> 0:12:16.750
But we'll keep to the very essence, the force to tell the truth

83
0:12:16.890 --> 0:12:20.490
We were chosen by the slayer, we will surprise them with a laugh

84
0:12:20.490 --> 0:12:26.970
We are harder than gold, we were harder than gold

85
0:12:28.270 --> 0:12:32.090
We were told to hold the border, and that is what we did

86
0:12:32.590 --> 0:12:35.810
Our new world is seen despite all that glow

87
0:12:36.330 --> 0:12:43.090
We, we will resist and fight, fight hard, cause we are gold inside

88
0:12:45.050 --> 0:12:50.810
We, we take our bombs and fight, fight hard, resist and do what's right

89
0:12:50.950 --> 0:12:54.950
Though we are fought with spears, the dead have closed their doors

90
0:12:54.950 --> 0:12:58.950
And they're suited to Moses, the poor are their slavers

91
0:12:58.950 --> 0:13:02.750
Though we are fought with spears, the dead have closed their doors

92
0:13:02.950 --> 0:13:06.510
And they're suited to Moses, the poor are their slavers

93
0:13:43.950 --> 0:13:50.990
We, we will resist and fight, fight hard, cause we are gold inside

94
0:13:51.230 --> 0:13:58.810
We, we take our bombs and fight, fight hard, resist and do what's right

95
0:14:32.240 --> 0:14:39.400
Oh, my friends, pardon my language, but it's so fucking good to be back

96
0:14:43.070 --> 0:14:45.810
Ten years ago, we stood on this stage for the first time

97
0:14:46.070 --> 0:14:51.070
We had 20 minutes, it was round about lunchtime or something like that

98
0:14:51.070 --> 0:14:53.970
And I remember the people who were in the front row

99
0:14:54.070 --> 0:14:57.020
Were all pretty damn hungover, okay, or hungover, sorry

100
0:14:57.020 --> 0:15:01.670
And I remember when I asked you to headbang, you all headbanged once

101
0:15:02.070 --> 0:15:05.890
Then you realized how much beer you had the night before

102
0:15:06.410 --> 0:15:11.150
So, however, we do have a little bit more than 20 minutes tonight

103
0:15:14.430 --> 0:15:17.370
We're gonna go all in and do 30 minutes for you guys

104
0:15:20.450 --> 0:15:21.850
Cause we're such nice Swedish guys

105
0:15:22.550 --> 0:15:24.230
Anyway, we're gonna do a bit of a mix here

106
0:15:24.250 --> 0:15:26.710
But obviously we just released a new album called The Great War

107
0:15:28.890 --> 0:15:31.950
So there will be some stuff from that, there will also be some older stuff

108
0:15:34.610 --> 0:15:40.850
So we're gonna have new shit, old shit, and some songs are just plain shit, so

109
0:16:00.810 --> 0:16:01.930
You want us to play that song?

110
0:16:08.250 --> 0:16:10.690
Let's do Fields of Verdun!

111
0:16:52.590 --> 0:16:56.970
300, the day's spreading on the sun, Fields of Verdun!

112
0:16:58.470 --> 0:17:01.670
Then the battle has begun, nowhere to run

113
0:17:01.670 --> 0:17:04.210
Father and son, all one by one

114
0:17:04.350 --> 0:17:06.790
Under their gun, they will be done

115
0:17:08.400 --> 0:17:11.600
Death and justice has begun, nowhere to run

116
0:17:11.700 --> 0:17:15.380
Father and son, all one by one, Fields of Verdun!

117
0:17:15.700 --> 0:17:18.340
Though a million ships have scattered out

118
0:17:18.340 --> 0:17:20.480
The battle has begun, from the crest, the upper hand

119
0:17:20.980 --> 0:17:25.380
From the ground up onto trenches, where the soldiers make their stand

120
0:17:25.700 --> 0:17:30.300
As the trenches slowly turn to blood, and the Greek police start to flood

121
0:17:30.700 --> 0:17:35.880
There's a wait in every corner, to die in the blood, for the trenches of blood

122
0:17:37.140 --> 0:17:39.320
The second, in the darkness

123
0:17:41.630 --> 0:17:46.530
300, the day's spreading on the sun, Fields of Verdun!

124
0:17:47.970 --> 0:17:51.150
Then the battle has begun, nowhere to run

125
0:17:51.150 --> 0:17:53.710
Father and son, all one by one

126
0:17:53.890 --> 0:17:56.290
Under their gun, they will be done

127
0:17:57.880 --> 0:18:01.100
Death and justice has begun, nowhere to run

128
0:18:01.240 --> 0:18:04.980
Father and son, all one by one, Fields of Verdun!

129
0:18:10.860 --> 0:18:15.080
Fields of execution, put away slag from the grass

130
0:18:15.780 --> 0:18:19.500
Thou shalt go no further, it was said, they shall pass

131
0:18:20.440 --> 0:18:24.900
The spirit of resistance and the madness of the war

132
0:18:25.380 --> 0:18:28.440
So go ahead, take your lead, jump to death, or you die playing the...

133
0:18:51.290 --> 0:18:53.690
The second, in the darkness

134
0:18:56.020 --> 0:19:00.660
300, the day's spreading on the sun, Fields of Verdun!

135
0:19:02.020 --> 0:19:05.020
Then the battle has begun, nowhere to

136
0:19:05.520 --> 0:19:07.920
Father and son, all one by one

137
0:19:08.020 --> 0:19:10.480
Under their gun, they will be done

138
0:19:12.020 --> 0:19:15.040
Then the judgment has begun, nowhere to run

139
0:19:15.040 --> 0:19:19.020
Father and son, all one by one, Fields of Verdun!

140
0:19:31.880 --> 0:19:33.500
Alright bloodsuckers, you want more?

141
0:19:37.010 --> 0:19:38.290
Hussars!

142
0:19:40.950 --> 0:19:42.830
The new England starts to grind

143
0:19:43.950 --> 0:19:46.650
Hey! Let's see some hands in the air!

144
0:19:47.810 --> 0:19:48.390
Hey!

145
0:20:05.570 --> 0:20:08.290
A cry for help, a tithe of mead

146
0:20:08.370 --> 0:20:10.850
A weight relieved from holy lead

147
0:20:11.190 --> 0:20:14.850
60 days of siege of Dumberley

148
0:20:16.410 --> 0:20:21.190
Sent a message to the sky, wounded soldiers left to die

149
0:20:21.710 --> 0:20:25.350
Will they hold the wall, or will the siege be gone?

150
0:20:26.570 --> 0:20:32.110
Medication, indigestion, their number, fifty to one

151
0:20:33.090 --> 0:20:36.330
Now the battle has begun, the new England starts to grind

152
0:20:37.370 --> 0:20:37.810
Hey!

153
0:20:39.570 --> 0:20:41.450
Coming down from the mountainside

154
0:20:44.880 --> 0:20:46.680
The new England starts to grind

155
0:20:50.070 --> 0:20:51.970
Coming down with a turn of tide

156
0:20:59.550 --> 0:21:04.290
As the days are passing by, and as the dead are piling high

157
0:21:04.730 --> 0:21:07.630
No escape and no salvation

158
0:21:09.890 --> 0:21:14.750
Trenches to explosive holes, are buried deep beneath the walls

159
0:21:14.910 --> 0:21:19.070
Plant the charges there, and watch the siege be feared

160
0:21:19.870 --> 0:21:25.290
How will you catch the inspiration, the grace against the vile?

161
0:21:26.610 --> 0:21:27.910
The grace against the vile

162
0:21:27.910 --> 0:21:29.890
Now the new England starts to grind

163
0:21:30.850 --> 0:21:31.190
Hey!

164
0:21:32.910 --> 0:21:34.830
Coming down from the mountainside

165
0:21:35.910 --> 0:21:36.310
Hey!

166
0:21:37.910 --> 0:21:39.910
The new England starts to grind

167
0:21:42.330 --> 0:21:42.950
Hey!

168
0:21:43.330 --> 0:21:45.210
Coming down with a turn of tide

169
0:21:46.330 --> 0:21:46.810
Hey!

170
0:21:49.880 --> 0:21:51.880
Shivering bolts are coming down from the sky

171
0:21:52.640 --> 0:21:54.520
Jenny says, are you ready to die?

172
0:21:54.880 --> 0:21:57.160
With this you'll never know the sign for a ride

173
0:22:00.170 --> 0:22:02.170
We'll be swept up from the steps of our gates

174
0:22:03.090 --> 0:22:04.950
All this fear will be facing our fate

175
0:22:05.730 --> 0:22:07.590
Like a corvus of the ceiling of fate

176
0:22:31.910 --> 0:22:35.930
Remember, it's September, as the wind's been yelling

177
0:22:35.930 --> 0:22:39.410
Now a spring, we may be in the mid-year

178
0:22:39.410 --> 0:22:41.410
But the wind does start to rise

179
0:22:41.950 --> 0:22:42.990
Are you ready still?

180
0:22:44.290 --> 0:22:46.410
You're coming down from the mountainside

181
0:22:47.030 --> 0:22:47.090
Hey!

182
0:22:48.830 --> 0:22:51.430
The wind does start to rise

183
0:22:54.030 --> 0:22:56.470
Coming down with a turn of tide

184
0:23:00.410 --> 0:23:02.410
The wind does start to rise

185
0:23:04.910 --> 0:23:06.660
Coming down from the mountainside

186
0:23:10.380 --> 0:23:11.930
The wind does start to rise

187
0:23:15.730 --> 0:23:16.980
Coming down with

188
0:23:16.980 --> 0:23:18.500
Coming down with a turn of tide

189
0:23:22.670 --> 0:23:27.510
We remember, it's September, when the wind does start to rise

190
0:23:51.030 --> 0:23:55.490
In the drought of 1917, our land was from tender seed

191
0:23:56.910 --> 0:24:01.090
Overseas through the trenches we went, from the land of the free

192
0:24:02.870 --> 0:24:07.390
Into war he brought two things along, a life full of disbelief

193
0:24:08.650 --> 0:24:12.390
John the writer supplied the site to 328

194
0:24:14.310 --> 0:24:18.650
There, on that day, down in New York, they entered the frame

195
0:24:19.350 --> 0:24:23.210
Saving the day, they too said, but not aware

196
0:24:24.650 --> 0:24:28.590
Into the fires of hell they had gone, not a hero to be

197
0:24:29.150 --> 0:24:34.650
Entered the war from overseas, they came in 1984, the way through the demise

198
0:24:34.650 --> 0:24:37.570
The fires of hell, the demise, built in 123

199
0:24:51.710 --> 0:24:56.510
When his fate has been put to the test, the call to arms he hears

200
0:24:57.670 --> 0:25:02.490
On the 8th of October he went, made a sergeant for his deeds

201
0:25:03.550 --> 0:25:07.970
There is bleeding, the rain of the war, machine gun on the hill

202
0:25:09.450 --> 0:25:13.970
Judge the enemy, take him, but we still have the power of his will

203
0:25:14.970 --> 0:25:19.010
There, on that day, sergeants flocked, they entered the frame

204
0:25:19.970 --> 0:25:23.970
Saving the day, they too said, but not aware

205
0:25:25.630 --> 0:25:28.970
Into the fires of hell they had gone, not a hero to be

206
0:25:29.850 --> 0:25:34.990
Entered the war from overseas, intervened 1918, the way through the demise

207
0:25:36.770 --> 0:25:37.970
Into 123

208
0:25:43.050 --> 0:25:47.670
What sergeant York achieved that day, records from the USA

209
0:25:48.590 --> 0:25:53.730
It's 82nd all the way, gets from above, but they now say

210
0:25:54.590 --> 0:25:59.670
What sergeant York achieved that day, records from the USA

211
0:26:00.590 --> 0:26:06.590
It's 82nd all the way, gets from above,

212
0:26:07.290 --> 0:26:11.090
Into the fires of hell they had gone, not a hero to be

213
0:26:33.290 --> 0:26:36.590
Entered the war from overseas, intervened 1918, the way through the demise

214
0:26:38.570 --> 0:26:38.930
Into 123

215
0:26:42.040 --> 0:26:46.740
What sergeant York achieved that day, records from the USA

216
0:26:47.040 --> 0:26:52.080
It's 82nd all the way, gets from above, but they now say

217
0:26:53.020 --> 0:26:56.860
Into the fires of hell they had gone, not a

218
0:26:57.540 --> 0:27:00.600
Entered the war from overseas, intervened 1918, the way through the demise

219
0:27:50.030 --> 0:27:52.030
Into 123

220
0:27:52.050 --> 0:27:53.350
In the sound of a machine gun, they didn't go in the night

221
0:27:58.050 --> 0:27:59.530
Mortars firing, rains the scene, scars the fields, and ones who agreed

222
0:28:04.050 --> 0:28:08.110
The stalemate had the throat high, where the Soviets rested mad

223
0:28:09.550 --> 0:28:16.030
The story should be won, but many men will suffer, know that many men will die

224
0:28:17.030 --> 0:28:22.050
Half a million lives at stake, at the fields, bomb has set bail

225
0:28:22.650 --> 0:28:27.790
As the night falls, the general calls, and the battle chariot's drawn

226
0:28:28.250 --> 0:28:32.090
And on, what is the purpose of it all?

227
0:28:34.060 --> 0:28:39.080
Once a price of a mile, thousands of feet march to the beat

228
0:28:39.880 --> 0:28:44.620
It's an army on the march, long away from home

229
0:28:45.900 --> 0:28:51.000
Day in the progress, in young men's lives, thousands of feet march to the beat

230
0:28:51.280 --> 0:28:55.900
It's an army in despair, kneeling in mud

231
0:28:57.280 --> 0:28:59.840
Stuck in a cage with no way out

232
0:29:05.350 --> 0:29:10.350
Thousands of machine guns, kept on firing during the night

233
0:29:11.330 --> 0:29:16.350
Mortars blaze, and wreck the scene, dumps the fields, and ones who agreed

234
0:29:16.930 --> 0:29:21.850
Still a deadlock at the front line, where the soldiers died mad

235
0:29:22.890 --> 0:29:28.080
Rooms and houses seem swung on, still no glory has been won

236
0:29:28.080 --> 0:29:33.230
Know that many men have suffered, know that many men have died

237
0:29:34.210 --> 0:29:39.350
Six miles of ground has been won, half a million men are gone

238
0:29:39.670 --> 0:29:44.350
And as the men call, the general calls, the killing carried on

239
0:29:45.070 --> 0:29:49.350
And on, what is the purpose of it all?

240
0:29:51.120 --> 0:29:55.920
Once a price of a mile, thousands of feet march to

241
0:29:55.920 --> 0:30:01.740
It's an army on the march, long away from home

242
0:30:02.920 --> 0:30:07.920
Day in the progress, in young men's lives, thousands of feet march to the beat

243
0:30:08.480 --> 0:30:13.920
It's an army in despair, kneeling in mud

244
0:30:14.440 --> 0:30:16.920
Stuck in a cage with no way out

245
0:30:28.560 --> 0:30:33.150
Young men are dying, they pay the price

246
0:30:34.150 --> 0:30:38.170
Oh, how they suffer, so kill me

247
0:30:38.750 --> 0:31:09.080
Once a price of a mile, there's a price for a mile

248
0:31:10.060 --> 0:31:14.960
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army on the march

249
0:31:16.100 --> 0:31:21.400
Long away from home, day in the progress, in young men's lives

250
0:31:21.620 --> 0:31:25.840
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army in despair

251
0:31:27.460 --> 0:31:32.460
Kneeling in mud, stuck in a trench with no way out

252
0:31:33.060 --> 0:31:37.460
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army on the march

253
0:31:38.460 --> 0:31:43.480
Long away from home, day in the progress, in young men's lives

254
0:31:44.460 --> 0:31:48.720
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army in despair

255
0:31:50.440 --> 0:31:55.460
Kneeling in mud, stuck in a trench with no way out

256
0:31:55.980 --> 0:32:00.720
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army on the march

257
0:32:01.700 --> 0:32:06.800
Long away from home, day in the progress, in young men's lives

258
0:32:08.370 --> 0:32:12.180
Thousands of feet march to the beat, it's an army in despair

259
0:32:13.220 --> 0:32:18.600
Kneeling in mud, stuck in a trench with no way out

260
0:33:17.450 --> 0:33:25.550
From the mist, a shape, a ship is taking form

261
0:33:26.550 --> 0:33:30.990
And the silence of the seas are bound to drift into a storm

262
0:33:32.470 --> 0:33:36.110
Sign of power, show of force

263
0:33:37.550 --> 0:33:41.190
Raise the anchor, battle ships, floating its course

264
0:33:42.090 --> 0:33:46.330
Crane of a nation, a beast made of steel

265
0:33:47.150 --> 0:33:51.350
This marking motion, king of the ocean

266
0:33:51.670 --> 0:33:56.150
It was made to rule the waves across the seven seas

267
0:33:59.630 --> 0:34:06.130
To lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

268
0:34:09.740 --> 0:34:15.530
The terror of the seas, the Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

269
0:34:17.370 --> 0:34:21.370
Two thousand men and fifty thousand tons of steel

270
0:34:21.890 --> 0:34:26.830
Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heels

271
0:34:28.170 --> 0:34:31.910
Firepower, firefight

272
0:34:33.210 --> 0:34:36.590
Battle stations, keep your targets set in sight

273
0:34:37.590 --> 0:34:41.310
Interformation, the heart has begun

274
0:34:41.310 --> 0:34:44.590
Kill that damnation

275
0:34:45.550 --> 0:34:51.570
The fleet is coming, it was made to rule the waves across the seven seas

276
0:34:55.440 --> 0:35:01.860
To lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

277
0:35:05.260 --> 0:35:10.950
The terror of the seas, the Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

278
0:35:29.420 --> 0:35:32.730
Bottom of the ocean, the depths of the abyss

279
0:35:33.070 --> 0:35:38.320
They're bound by the flagship of the navy

280
0:35:38.440 --> 0:35:43.320
The terror of the seas, these guns have been silent at last

281
0:36:30.700 --> 0:36:34.840
Crane of a nation, a beast made of steel

282
0:36:35.680 --> 0:36:39.980
This marking motion, king of the ocean

283
0:36:40.320 --> 0:36:44.760
It was made to rule the waves across the seven seas

284
0:36:48.540 --> 0:36:55.280
To lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

285
0:36:58.750 --> 0:37:04.350
The terror of the seas, the Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

286
0:37:07.640 --> 0:37:12.780
To lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

287
0:37:15.010 --> 0:37:19.310
The terror of the seas, Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

288
0:37:22.630 --> 0:37:27.790
To lead the war machine, to rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

289
0:37:30.180 --> 0:37:34.740
The terror of the seas, Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

290
0:38:18.740 --> 0:38:19.060
Thank you very much, I'm so impressed

291
0:38:22.900 --> 0:38:28.520
You know, the hospitality, the local crew, everyone involved in making Bloodstock happen

292
0:38:29.880 --> 0:38:34.180
Are really fucking good people, so will you please all make some noise for Bloodstock

293
0:38:40.090 --> 0:38:43.450
Alright, how about a little bit more heavy metal

294
0:38:45.690 --> 0:38:47.710
How about something with a hammered organ

295
0:38:50.110 --> 0:38:51.690
How about something about a pirate

296
0:38:53.550 --> 0:38:54.760
How about the Red Baron

297
0:38:58.470 --> 0:39:02.490
Now you're a shield, you're not a bed, between the fighting circus of the man from Russia

298
0:39:03.450 --> 0:39:07.530
Tie up, clean, the spike of man's ego, paint the rest of the continent all the way to Russia

299
0:39:08.730 --> 0:39:11.330
You're from above, you're under fire

300
0:39:13.430 --> 0:39:16.430
Stained with his blood, disrobing higher

301
0:39:18.420 --> 0:39:22.820
Though I'm a soldier, throw the horse back to the skies

302
0:39:23.920 --> 0:39:26.420
Then the legend will arise

303
0:39:27.420 --> 0:39:30.460
And he's flying higher, he came from the sky

304
0:39:31.240 --> 0:39:34.180
He's flying to Pasta and he's flying to Nye, higher

305
0:39:35.120 --> 0:39:37.420
But I'm far on Nye, the legend will never die

306
0:39:38.420 --> 0:39:42.440
First to the seas, so these are machines, gladiator and the giant's third

307
0:39:43.420 --> 0:39:47.460
Fire and bullets, they're ready with the kills, ready to face the dominant, it's burning

308
0:39:48.420 --> 0:39:51.420
Let me face the famous squadron leader

309
0:39:52.420 --> 0:39:57.020
Call on this name, let the country go

310
0:39:59.050 --> 0:40:02.710
In the gate to win, a gambler runs the dice

311
0:40:03.690 --> 0:40:06.690
The alien lights pay the price

312
0:40:07.690 --> 0:40:10.390
And he's flying higher, he came from the sky

313
0:40:11.650 --> 0:40:14.490
He's flying to Pasta and he's flying to Nye, higher

314
0:40:15.490 --> 0:40:18.280
But I'm far on Nye, the legend will never die

315
0:40:18.280 --> 0:40:18.430
Fire!

316
0:40:27.190 --> 0:40:29.370
Alright, let's make some noise together my friends

317
0:40:31.960 --> 0:40:34.980
One, two, one, two, three, four, higher

318
0:40:39.360 --> 0:40:40.180
Higher

319
0:40:42.320 --> 0:40:45.280
One, two, one, two, three, four, higher

320
0:40:46.850 --> 0:40:47.610
One more time

321
0:40:49.530 --> 0:40:50.330
Higher

322
0:40:55.850 --> 0:41:00.070
He came from the sky, he's flying to Pasta and he's flying to Nye, higher

323
0:41:00.530 --> 0:41:03.870
But I'm far on Nye, the legend will never die

324
0:41:04.790 --> 0:41:05.290
Higher

325
0:41:30.540 --> 0:41:34.170
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies

326
0:41:35.390 --> 0:41:37.950
And the legend never dies

327
0:41:39.090 --> 0:41:43.110
And he's flying, and he's flying, and he's flying, higher

328
0:41:43.950 --> 0:41:48.090
He came from the sky, flying to Pasta and he's flying to Nye, higher

329
0:41:48.970 --> 0:41:51.850
But I'm far on Nye, the legend will never die

330
0:41:52.770 --> 0:41:52.950
Higher

331
0:41:54.010 --> 0:41:58.290
He came from the sky, flying to Pasta and he's flying to Nye, higher

332
0:41:59.090 --> 0:42:01.950
But I'm far on Nye, the legend will never die

333
0:43:11.740 --> 0:43:16.740
A time of religion and war, let us tell the tale of a lion

334
0:43:17.740 --> 0:43:22.560
This beast in the shape of a man, with a dream to rule sea and land

335
0:43:23.740 --> 0:43:29.160
And all those who stand in his way, die by God, in victorious arms

336
0:43:30.620 --> 0:43:34.800
The righteous that follows, sounds his moan, it is your due

337
0:43:36.260 --> 0:43:42.740
Victims have taught, that those fought, this lion is no fear at all

338
0:43:43.340 --> 0:43:47.640
Lion of hope, comes from the north, from the north

339
0:43:50.740 --> 0:43:56.740
You starve us, by going first, we fear our heads, we fear our hearts

340
0:43:57.260 --> 0:44:02.740
Our cherry books, they tingle, our goose stop, our rock will stop

341
0:44:06.500 --> 0:44:11.020
A story of Europe, a fish farmer, a dream of destruction

342
0:44:12.500 --> 0:44:17.340
The power of the crown of freedom, in a capital he's able to take

343
0:44:18.500 --> 0:44:23.420
The future of our fatherland, show the way, it was still war today

344
0:44:24.500 --> 0:44:29.500
The leader of that mass, featuring that guns, was no easy foe

345
0:44:30.500 --> 0:44:37.500
A story so bold, truth unfold, with truth of the union of peoples

346
0:44:38.300 --> 0:44:42.780
He loved the lion and king, lion and king

347
0:44:45.500 --> 0:44:51.500
You starve us, by going first, we fear our heads, we fear our hearts

348
0:44:52.160 --> 0:44:57.500
Our cherry books, they tingle, our goose stop, our rock will stop

349
0:44:58.440 --> 0:45:02.600
You starve us, by going first, we fear our heads, we fear our hearts

350
0:45:04.500 --> 0:45:10.340
Our cherry books, they tingle, our goose stop, our rock will stop

351
0:45:18.960 --> 0:45:24.920
Mighty eagle, rule alone liberator

352
0:45:25.380 --> 0:45:31.940
Take the lion from the north Atlantic, the sector from his head

353
0:45:32.480 --> 0:45:36.840
Mighty eagle, rule alone liberator

354
0:45:37.880 --> 0:45:43.620
Take the lion from the north Atlantic, the sector from his head

355
0:45:43.620 --> 0:45:47.920
Mighty eagle, rule alone liberator

356
0:45:47.980 --> 0:45:55.190
Take the lion from the north Atlantic, the sector from his head

357
0:45:56.170 --> 0:46:00.190
Mighty eagle, rule alone liberator

358
0:46:01.170 --> 0:46:07.910
Take the lion from the north Atlantic, the sector from his head

359
0:46:34.670 --> 0:46:38.160
Mighty eagle, rule alone

360
0:46:38.160 --> 0:46:41.900
And so start this lion, the storm, the bearer of the heart

361
0:46:42.180 --> 0:46:46.920
Lion come forth, come from the north, come from the north

362
0:46:49.790 --> 0:46:55.570
You starve us, by going first, we fear our heads, we fear our hearts

363
0:46:56.010 --> 0:47:01.570
Our cherry books, they tingle, our goose stop, our rock will stop

364
0:47:02.350 --> 0:47:06.550
You starve us, by going first, we fear our heads, we fear our hearts

365
0:47:08.590 --> 0:47:14.350
Our cherry books, they tingle, our goose stop, our rock will stop

366
0:47:46.930 --> 0:47:48.400
All is ready

367
0:48:15.050 --> 0:48:19.510
All embrace me, it's my time to rule at last

368
0:48:20.470 --> 0:48:25.430
Fifteen years have I been waiting to sing it out for my brood

369
0:48:31.330 --> 0:48:34.770
No allegiance, I will swing a wolf

370
0:48:36.650 --> 0:48:41.590
Crowned by God, not by the church, as my power makes me right

371
0:48:46.450 --> 0:48:52.830
It's hard, I was too young to rule the land, just as they failed to understand, boy, to rule

372
0:48:54.170 --> 0:48:58.170
My time to pass, but I was chosen by heaven

373
0:48:59.170 --> 0:49:02.370
Say my name when you pray to the sky

374
0:49:02.690 --> 0:49:06.010
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

375
0:49:07.850 --> 0:49:12.010
With a law, my protector, make it bow to my will

376
0:49:12.310 --> 0:49:16.790
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

377
0:49:20.440 --> 0:49:25.240
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

378
0:49:34.890 --> 0:49:39.350
Brooding battle, led my men to victory

379
0:49:40.530 --> 0:49:45.530
No man alive or dead commands me, I answer to the Lord

380
0:49:51.370 --> 0:49:55.250
Hear my order, question me and die

381
0:49:56.950 --> 0:50:01.950
What I say was said in heaven, the soul is shall be done

382
0:50:06.890 --> 0:50:13.250
No, I was destined to rule alone, all for myself, I am claimed to throne, born to rule

383
0:50:14.890 --> 0:50:18.750
My time to pass, but I was chosen by heaven

384
0:50:19.750 --> 0:50:22.910
Say my name when you pray to the sky

385
0:50:24.590 --> 0:50:26.650
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

386
0:50:28.290 --> 0:50:32.470
With a law, my protector, make it bow to my will

387
0:50:32.750 --> 0:50:37.390
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

388
0:50:40.430 --> 0:50:45.620
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

389
0:50:55.150 --> 0:50:58.590
All the sky shall be mine, there's no stopping me

390
0:51:00.150 --> 0:51:03.890
All over Europe, my rule shall be questioned by God

391
0:51:05.930 --> 0:51:09.480
All I seek and to me, that is my decree

392
0:51:11.650 --> 0:51:14.790
My will be done

393
0:51:38.490 --> 0:51:44.750
But I was too young to rule alone, just as they failed to understand what to know

394
0:51:46.490 --> 0:51:51.650
My time is now, I was chosen by heaven

395
0:51:52.650 --> 0:51:55.730
Say my name when you pray to the sky

396
0:51:57.350 --> 0:51:59.110
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

397
0:52:00.130 --> 0:52:08.960
To the sky, with a law, my protector, make it bow to my will

398
0:52:09.560 --> 0:52:13.820
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

399
0:52:17.270 --> 0:52:22.030
To the sky, it's the God of all the skies

400
0:52:22.030 --> 0:52:22.310
Rise!

401
0:53:07.690 --> 0:53:08.030
Rise!

402
0:53:12.410 --> 0:53:13.110
Rise!

403
0:53:17.450 --> 0:53:18.090
Rise!

404
0:53:33.590 --> 0:53:38.190
From the depths of hellish silence, bastard spells, explosive violence

405
0:53:38.670 --> 0:53:43.190
Russian minds have my protected, glorious mission undetected

406
0:53:44.190 --> 0:53:48.190
Put down in all the flames, I'm going strong, I'm half-moon's number one

407
0:53:49.110 --> 0:53:53.030
Talking with the moon, looking for the truth, I'm moon's number one

408
0:53:53.870 --> 0:53:58.190
You can hide, you can move, just to write, learn to expect, learn to think dark

409
0:53:59.110 --> 0:54:03.190
Silence is the night, the witch is in the fight, never miss the mark

410
0:54:04.150 --> 0:54:08.090
Canvas, wings of death, the pattern is your fate

411
0:54:09.190 --> 0:54:13.030
Night on the regiment, 188

412
0:54:14.190 --> 0:54:19.090
Undetected, unexpected, wings of glory, tell the story

413
0:54:19.530 --> 0:54:24.110
Deviation, deviation, undetected, stealth, perfected

414
0:54:24.330 --> 0:54:28.150
Silence in ground, retreated to the sound, helpless in the air

415
0:54:29.130 --> 0:54:33.150
Suddenly appears, the world in your face, mindful, the witch is there

416
0:54:33.830 --> 0:54:36.850
Let it fall, come around, I don't sound so, we're about to drown

417
0:54:37.210 --> 0:54:41.210
Lashes, standing high, the old genie awaits, the beaten at the gates

418
0:54:41.790 --> 0:54:43.430
Just to fight and fly

419
0:54:44.250 --> 0:54:48.190
Canvas, wings of death, the pattern is your fate

420
0:54:49.270 --> 0:54:53.070
Night on the regiment, 188

421
0:54:54.190 --> 0:54:59.110
Undetected, unexpected, wings of glory, tell the story

422
0:54:59.470 --> 0:55:04.110
Deviation, deviation, undetected, stealth, perfected

423
0:55:24.140 --> 0:55:27.410
Beneath the starlight of the heavens

424
0:55:29.200 --> 0:55:31.720
Unlikely heroes in disguise

425
0:55:31.720 --> 0:55:34.040
Canvas, wings of death, the witch is gonna die

426
0:55:34.660 --> 0:55:37.320
Stay in fear, humble horizon

427
0:55:39.540 --> 0:55:43.460
Win when wisdom, and the night witch has come

428
0:55:44.460 --> 0:55:48.560
Undetected, unexpected, wings of glory, tell the story

429
0:55:49.480 --> 0:55:53.540
Deviation, deviation, undetected, stealth, perfected

430
0:55:54.340 --> 0:55:58.140
From the depths of hell in silence, lost in spells, explosive violence

431
0:55:59.260 --> 0:56:04.220
Russian beta, but perfected, bonus mission, undetected

432
0:56:29.680 --> 0:56:38.850
Vision of fire, of men, of wax, of sound, of human flesh

433
0:56:41.550 --> 0:56:44.380
Soul connects me, fire gives sign of my desperation

434
0:56:46.810 --> 0:56:50.830
All these sounds, echo in my mind, misconducted by death himself

435
0:56:51.810 --> 0:56:58.310
They all come together as music, the rhythm of

436
0:56:58.310 --> 0:56:58.730
The rhythm of death

437
0:57:02.950 --> 0:57:04.210
A sense of hope

438
0:57:07.930 --> 0:57:12.550
From the land, as they may just stand, they so strong, yet the legend still lives on

439
0:57:24.230 --> 0:57:26.470
1918, the great war, great to some

440
0:57:27.030 --> 0:57:30.950
A battalion is lost in the, my god, hell

441
0:57:35.130 --> 0:57:37.450
Under fire, there's nothing they can do

442
0:57:37.890 --> 0:57:40.610
There's no way they can get a message through

443
0:57:45.540 --> 0:57:49.880
Suffering, they're in losses, but the battle carries on

444
0:57:50.880 --> 0:57:54.080
Liberty, division, standing strong

445
0:57:56.650 --> 0:58:00.990
From the land, as they may just stand, a disregard of the man

446
0:58:01.810 --> 0:58:04.090
It's a rather long die, and the stakes are high

447
0:58:04.850 --> 0:58:06.970
In what they die, there's no time for goodbye

448
0:58:07.550 --> 0:58:11.810
Weapon in hand, as they may just stand, to disregard the demand

449
0:58:12.690 --> 0:58:15.070
Then it never comes why they would rather die

450
0:58:15.730 --> 0:58:18.070
Through the blood, they will finally be saved

451
0:58:24.130 --> 0:58:26.150
25, the ammunition's running low

452
0:58:27.010 --> 0:58:29.510
The supplies, they were dropped off on the floor

453
0:58:34.640 --> 0:58:36.700
1918, the war still, great to some

454
0:58:37.640 --> 0:58:41.440
The battalion's trapped in the, my god, hell

455
0:58:45.170 --> 0:58:49.700
Chose not to surrender, they chose victory or defeat

456
0:58:51.100 --> 0:58:54.200
War and blood, they're blessed in by their fate

457
0:58:56.640 --> 0:59:01.080
From the land, as they may just stand, a disregard of the man

458
0:59:01.780 --> 0:59:04.100
It's a rather long die, and the stakes are high

459
0:59:04.820 --> 0:59:06.900
In what they die, there's no time for goodbye

460
0:59:07.520 --> 0:59:11.820
Weapon in hand, as they may just stand, to disregard the demand

461
0:59:12.640 --> 0:59:15.080
Then it never comes why they would rather die

462
0:59:15.760 --> 0:59:18.080
Through the blood, they will finally be saved

463
0:59:39.820 --> 0:59:44.310
From the land, as they may just stand, a disregard of the man

464
0:59:45.270 --> 0:59:47.310
It's a rather long die, and the stakes are high

465
0:59:48.230 --> 0:59:50.270
In what they die, there's no time for goodbye

466
0:59:50.870 --> 0:59:55.270
Weapon in hand, as they may just stand, to disregard the demand

467
0:59:56.270 --> 0:59:58.290
Then it never comes why they would rather die

468
0:59:59.110 --> 1:00:01.130
Through the blood, they will finally be saved

469
1:00:02.070 --> 1:00:06.230
Suffering heavy losses, in the great war they stood strong

470
1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:10.230
The memory of the fallen, still inside

471
1:00:12.530 --> 1:00:17.380
From the land, as they may just stand, a disregard of the man

472
1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:20.400
It's a rather long die, and the stakes are high

473
1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:23.320
In what they die, there's no time for goodbye

474
1:00:23.820 --> 1:00:28.260
Weapon in hand, as they may just stand, to disregard the demand

475
1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:31.380
Then it never comes why they would rather die

476
1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:34.380
Through the blood, they will finally be saved

477
1:00:35.380 --> 1:01:03.900
You crazy, crazy people

478
1:01:22.890 --> 1:01:23.350
I'm sorry

479
1:01:24.530 --> 1:01:25.470
You fucking asshole

480
1:01:26.730 --> 1:01:28.530
We said we weren't doing that song this night

481
1:01:31.190 --> 1:01:32.270
Now I totally lost it

482
1:01:33.130 --> 1:01:35.190
I had something planned I wasn't about to tell you

483
1:01:35.590 --> 1:01:36.790
Now it's totally gone

484
1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:40.430
I fucking suck as a frontman

485
1:01:42.850 --> 1:01:44.170
Oh, now I got it, yeah

486
1:01:44.870 --> 1:01:46.590
Lost Battalion, a song about the First World War

487
1:01:47.290 --> 1:01:50.150
Now, I thought, if it's okay with you guys

488
1:01:51.370 --> 1:01:54.010
I'm gonna teach you a fact tonight

489
1:01:56.890 --> 1:01:58.450
Something quite interesting

490
1:02:00.730 --> 1:02:03.730
From the battlefields of World War I

491
1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:06.540
This is a scary fact

492
1:02:07.420 --> 1:02:09.600
There's only 40 years back in history

493
1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:13.420
Until we find the last stand of the samurai

494
1:02:43.870 --> 1:02:48.430
It's the nature of time that the old ways must give in

495
1:02:49.690 --> 1:02:53.570
It's the nature of time that the new ways come sincing

496
1:02:54.870 --> 1:02:59.330
When the new meets the old, it always pans the ancient ways

497
1:03:00.870 --> 1:03:04.870
And as the story told, the old ways go out in a blaze

498
1:03:05.870 --> 1:03:08.650
The circle by a vulture

499
1:03:09.410 --> 1:03:11.430
The end of ancient culture

500
1:03:12.190 --> 1:03:14.830
The dawn of destiny draws near

501
1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:20.400
Imperial force to fight

502
1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:23.360
Face the 500 samurai

503
1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:26.380
For mother and her lover

504
1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:29.360
Fix the Chihuahua, the sword, raise the gun

505
1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:31.440
Bujiro, the game you fight

506
1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.360
It's the last stand of the samurai

507
1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:37.380
For mother and her lover

508
1:03:42.570 --> 1:03:44.000
That's when the new ways begins

509
1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:47.000
The way of the warrior comes to an end

510
1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.000
That's when

511
1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:49.720
That's when the new ways begins

512
1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:52.680
The ways of the old must not be had

513
1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.740
It's the nature of time that the old ways must give in

514
1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:03.820
It's the nature of time that the new ways come sincing

515
1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.360
On your throne, surrender

516
1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:10.460
Seek out the old contender

517
1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:13.760
The dawn of destiny is near

518
1:04:17.740 --> 1:04:19.190
Imperial force

519
1:04:19.190 --> 1:04:21.430
Face the 500 samurai

520
1:04:21.450 --> 1:04:23.150
For mother and her lover

521
1:04:25.430 --> 1:04:27.490
Fix the Chihuahua, the sword, raise the gun

522
1:04:28.430 --> 1:04:30.490
Bujiro, the game you fight

523
1:04:31.430 --> 1:04:33.430
It's the last stand of the samurai

524
1:04:34.430 --> 1:04:36.450
For mother and her lover

525
1:05:03.210 --> 1:05:04.870
Till the time we hold on

526
1:05:05.830 --> 1:05:07.890
Only torn and left at the end

527
1:05:08.830 --> 1:05:10.830
No more life, none

528
1:05:11.790 --> 1:05:13.510
Shiromiya boy

529
1:05:15.750 --> 1:05:17.630
Imperial force to fight

530
1:05:18.050 --> 1:05:20.170
Face the 500 samurai

531
1:05:21.310 --> 1:05:23.430
Surrender, hand out numbers

532
1:05:23.810 --> 1:05:26.330
Fix the Chihuahua, the sword, raise the gun

533
1:05:26.930 --> 1:05:28.770
Bujiro, the game you fight

534
1:05:29.270 --> 1:05:31.250

558
1:07:33.730 --> 1:07:35.730
I'm a god of 42

559
1:07:36.230 --> 1:07:37.750

In the rise of the steps to heaven

570
1:08:04.230 --> 1:08:05.750

First to the feast

746
1:18:57.210 --> 1:18:58.210
Destiny waiting

747
1:19:01.070 --> 1:19:02.190
No breath

748
1:19:02.990 --> 1:19:04.230
Arrgh, you fucking asshole!

749
1:19:38.010 --> 1:19:39.150
Swedish Pegas

750
1:19:39.170 --> 1:19:40.690
Marching ashore

751
1:19:41.510 --> 1:19:42.350
Forged in fire

752
1:19:44.150 --> 1:19:45.170
By the hammer of Thor

753
1:19:46.330 --> 1:19:47.330
Out from Asgard

754
1:19:47.330 --> 1:19:48.330
Arise, kingship sails

755
1:19:48.710 --> 1:19:50.330
Never to turn back again

756
1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:09.320
January or February

757
1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:11.560
But we're gonna be at Wembley Arena, okay?

758
1:21:14.670 --> 1:21:15.710
So, I hope

759
1:21:16.390 --> 1:21:17.710
Each and every one of you will be there

760
1:21:21.050 --> 1:21:22.310
Yes, we will have lawyers going out

761
1:21:22.490 --> 1:21:23.910
With contracts later for you to sign

762
1:21:26.050 --> 1:21:26.410
Anyway

763
1:21:27.770 --> 1:21:29.250
As we're getting closer and closer to the end

764
1:21:30.390 --> 1:21:30.830
It is

765
1:21:32.610 --> 1:21:33.670
Oh, we're not really there yet

766
1:21:33.770 --> 1:21:34.670
You know how this works

767
1:21:38.220 --> 1:21:38.560
Just

768
1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:41.080
Well, yeah, let's start with you

769
1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.060
Most important people

770
1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:44.760
Thank you all for an absolutely fantastic evening, Bloodstock

771
1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:53.420
Always a pleasure to be here

772
1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:57.400
As I said earlier

773
1:21:58.400 --> 1:21:59.080
Once again

774
1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:02.140
Give it up for Bloodstock and the Bloodstock crew!

775
1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:08.760
And

776
1:22:10.130 --> 1:22:10.950
Yeah, let's try this

777
1:22:12.290 --> 1:22:13.630
I've seen Bruce Dickinson do this shit

778
1:22:13.630 --> 1:22:14.030
I've seen Bruce Dickinson do this shit on TV

779
1:23:53.550 --> 1:23:54.610
A short man from Texas

780
1:23:55.490 --> 1:23:56.590
A man of the wild

781
1:23:57.590 --> 1:23:58.590
Thrown into combat

782
1:23:59.330 --> 1:24:00.590
With bodies set high

783
1:24:01.410 --> 1:24:02.470
Height, gist, emotions

784
1:24:03.150 --> 1:24:04.530
His blood's running cold

785
1:24:05.550 --> 1:24:06.630
His hikes ripped through his story

786
1:24:06.970 --> 1:24:08.370
And falls

787
1:24:08.870 --> 1:24:09.550
But I ask

788
1:24:10.610 --> 1:24:11.030
How likely

789
1:24:12.610 --> 1:24:14.610
If there be any glory in war

790
1:24:15.590 --> 1:24:16.590
Let it rest

791
1:24:16.590 --> 1:24:16.710
On his leg here

792
1:24:17.730 --> 1:24:18.410
Who would do that?

793
1:24:19.610 --> 1:24:20.290
We can't buy

794
1:24:21.610 --> 1:24:23.670
Colossus from the Nazi yoke

795
1:24:24.070 --> 1:24:25.610
A lone soldier's sleep

796
1:24:25.610 --> 1:24:27.330
Under a metal six-feet thing

797
1:24:27.650 --> 1:24:29.210
A deathless wake

798
1:24:29.610 --> 1:24:31.170
Where snow will be made

799
1:24:31.770 --> 1:24:33.090
Such heart-rending attack

800
1:24:33.610 --> 1:24:34.910
Pull him to the metal and back

801
1:24:36.910 --> 1:24:37.690
A man of his 50's

802
1:24:42.290 --> 1:24:43.060
A man of stand-due

803
1:24:43.060 --> 1:24:44.640
Flesh all around him

804
1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:46.380
A man of his 50's

805
1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:48.020
Flesh all around him

806
1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:49.860
And yet he ain't through

807
1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:52.020
Let them fall face down

808
1:24:52.420 --> 1:24:53.800
Each day they must die

809
1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:55.560
Make it easier

810
1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:57.220
To say goodbye

811
1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:00.040
Bright, how I'd like

812
1:25:01.020 --> 1:25:02.100
If there be any glory in war

813
1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:06.020
Let it rest

814
1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:07.820
On his leg here

815
1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.200
Till the people never came back

816
1:25:13.190 --> 1:25:14.220
Colossus from

817
1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:14.650
A lone soldier's sleep

818
1:25:15.350 --> 1:25:16.470
Under a metal six-feet thing

819
1:25:17.390 --> 1:25:18.350
A deathless wake

820
1:25:19.350 --> 1:25:20.310
Where snow will be made

821
1:25:22.270 --> 1:25:23.330
Such heart-rending attack

822
1:25:23.350 --> 1:25:24.110
Pull him to the metal and back

823
1:25:26.010 --> 1:25:27.370
Vote down the wrong me

824
1:25:27.370 --> 1:25:28.030
And listen while I speak

825
1:25:30.030 --> 1:25:31.330
Oh, but hell, it's six-feet deep

826
1:25:31.850 --> 1:25:32.870
And all along the shore

827
1:25:33.350 --> 1:25:34.930
Where cannons still roar

828
1:25:35.350 --> 1:25:37.230
They're haunting my dreams

829
1:25:37.350 --> 1:25:39.110
They're still there when I sleep

830
1:25:39.410 --> 1:25:40.250
And I'm not sure

831
1:25:41.350 --> 1:25:42.210
What I can do

832
1:26:16.550 --> 1:26:17.470
He's Colossus from the Nazi yoke

833
1:26:17.470 --> 1:26:18.750
A lone soldier's sleep

834
1:26:19.410 --> 1:26:20.810
Under a metal six-feet thing

835
1:26:21.410 --> 1:26:22.630
A deathless wake

836
1:26:23.410 --> 1:26:24.550
Where snow will be made

837
1:26:26.390 --> 1:26:27.410
Such heart-rending attack

838
1:26:27.410 --> 1:26:28.350
Pull him to the metal and back

839
1:26:29.410 --> 1:26:30.090
Don't stop

840
1:26:31.410 --> 1:26:32.270
Thank you for your fantastic evening

841
1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:57.270
I hope we'll meet again

842
1:26:58.270 --> 1:26:58.690
Very soon

843
1:27:23.580 --> 1:27:24.980
At Wembley Arena, my friends

844
1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:27.360
Thank you

845
1:27:28.430 --> 1:27:29.490
Thank you

846
1:27:29.510 --> 1:27:29.590
Thank you

847
1:27:32.930 --> 1:27:33.430
Thank you all

848
1:27:34.430 --> 1:27:35.810
And enjoy the rest of the festival
